## Roles

### dApp Developer

We‚Äôre looking for a talented front-end or full-stack dApp Developer to help us build clean, functional and intuitive web applications to provide users with a great experience when interfacing mStable. Developing front-ends for mStable constitutes a unique challenge in needing to perform complex operations with on-chain data while abstracting complexity away from the end user.

The ideal dApp developer has an eye for details, cares about writing clean, quality, maintainable code and loves building intuitive UIs and solving problems for users.

See [dApp challenge](./dapp-developer/README.md).

### Full Stack Developer

We are looking for knowledge and expertise across the Ethereum ‚Äústack‚Äù - primarily Solidity & Javascript/Ethers/Web3js, with knowledge across the Ethereum ecosystem (scalability, governance, DeFi etc.). You will help us take mStable to the next level by designing and developing protocol improvements, integrating with leading CeFi and DeFi platforms, contributing to decentralized governance and executing on our packed roadmap of features and fixes.

See [full stack challenge](./full-stack/README.md).

### Protocol Engineer

We‚Äôre looking for a talented Ethereum developer with expertise across DeFi, financial/token engineering or governance mechanisms to help us take mStable to the next level. We have lots of exciting things planned on the roadmap and want to continue delivering innovative, robust and performant solutions as we move forward.

The ideal protocol engineer will find innovative solutions to tough problems by designing incentive mechanisms, protocol optimisations and governance mechanics in a fast moving DeFi ecosystem.

See [protocol challenge](./protocol-engineer/README.md) that should help us understand your ability to do the above.

## Testnet notes

See the [deployed addresses](https://docs.mstable.org/protocol/deployed-addresses) of the mStable contracts on the Ropsten network.

Need some bAssets to mint with? Head to [Aave Faucet](https://testnet.aave.com/faucet) for USDT and TUSD tokens, or the [Compound App](https://app.compound.finance/Asset/cUSDC) for USDC and DAI.

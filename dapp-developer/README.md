# DApp Challenge

So you want to work on interfaces with mStable?

If you're a seasoned coder, you should have no problems with the task, but don't
worry if you're new to the game either, we just want to see is how you solve
problems and innovate while interacting with Ethereum.

We really like to see clean, innovative interfaces and well written, modular and strongly typed code.

**Like the real world better?** Feel free to complete an issue with the tag `challenge` listed by our team on the [mStable-app](https://github.com/mstable/mstable-app/issues) instead.

# Task

Mary's mother wants to show her how easy and rewarding it can be to save money on the Ethereum network.
She wants to give Mary 5000 `USDC` to start with.

Create a sleek 'piggy bank' style application with a focus on simplifying UX as much as possible.
Choose from existing protocols (e.g. `mStable`, `Compound`, `Aave`) as the base layer for the savings mechanism.

The product should consist of:

- Frontend to allow Mary to easily deposit her funds and view her accruing interest
- Optional Smart Contract(s) to add additional functionality

## Suggestions

- Use our favourite tools - Typescript, GraphQL, React and Context API to make the client as fast as possible
- Use Local Ganache, Ropsten or Rinkeby as the test blockchain
- Use Web3js or Ethers library (or some wrapper) to connect to Ethereum and interact with the deployed smart contracts
- Provide some instructions to help us get everything up and running

### Bonus points

- Gamification
- Innovation: Show us what you can really do
  - e.g. gas costs too high? Add some gas minimisation strategies
  - e.g. maybe you want Mary to only spend the interest she gains from the capital and need to create additional wrapper contract
  - e.g. maybe the funds get converted into a different asset to optimise yield under the hood

# Submissions

Throw your solution on Github (private or public) and send an email with the link to [jobs@mstable.org](mailto:jobs@mstable.org) along with a short message on how you are perfect for the role, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

## Need USDC?

If you are deploying on the Ropsten or Rinkeby networks, you might need to get some USDC - try the faucets on [Aave](https://testnet.aave.com/faucet) or [Compound](https://app.compound.finance/Asset/cUSDC)

# DApp Challenge

So you want to work on interfaces with mStable?

If you're a seasoned coder, you should have no problems with the task, but don't
worry if you're new to the game either, we just want to see is how you solve
problems and innovate while interacting with Ethereum.

We really like to see clean, innovative interfaces and well written, modular and strongly typed code.

**Like the real world better?** Feel free to complete an issue with the tag `challenge` listed by our team on the [mStable-app](https://github.com/mstable/mstable-app/issues) instead.

Choose 1:

# Task 1

Create a todo list application with the following components:

 - Smart Contract: this should be the storage for all of the todo items that users are going to create
 - Frontend: this should allow you to interact with the todo list from a web interface

## Suggestions

- Use our favourite tools - Typescript, React and Context API to make the client as fast as possible
- Use Local Ganache, Ropsten or Rinkeby as the test blockchain
- Use Web3js or Ethers library (or some wrapper) to connect to Ethereum and interact with the deployed smart contracts
- Provide some instructions to help us get everything up and running

### Bonus points

- Make the UI pop with a sleek design
- Automated tests: flex your muscles and show us how you think about test cases
- Create a subgraph on [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/) to pull the data

# Task 2

Mary's mother wants to show her how easy and rewarding it can be to save money on the Ethereum network.
She wants to give Mary 5000 `USDC` to start with.

Create a sleek 'piggy bank' style application with a focus on simplifying UX as much as possible.
Choose from existing protocols (e.g. `mStable`, `Compound`, `Aave`) as the base layer for the savings mechanism.

The product should consist of:

- Frontend to allow Mary to easily deposit USDC and view her accruing interest
- Optional Smart Contract(s) to add additional functionality

## Suggestions

- Use our favourite tools - Typescript, GraphQL, React and Context API to make the client as fast as possible
- Use Local Ganache, Ropsten, Rinkeby as the network blockchain or Mainnet for real data
- Simulate some activity in the lending pools to accrue interest on the underlying
- Use Web3js or Ethers library (or some wrapper) to connect to Ethereum and interact with the deployed smart contracts
- Provide some instructions to help us get everything up and running

### Bonus points

- Gamification
  - e.g. maybe you want Mary to only spend the interest she gains from the capital and create an additional wrapper contract to support that
- Innovation: Show us what you can really do to make the UX smooth

# Submissions

Throw your solution on Github (private or public) and send an email with the link to [jobs@mstable.org](mailto:jobs@mstable.org) along with a short message on how you are perfect for the role, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

## Need USDC?

If you are deploying on the Ropsten or Rinkeby networks, you might need to get some USDC - try the faucets on [Aave](https://testnet.aave.com/faucet) or [Compound](https://app.compound.finance/Asset/cUSDC)

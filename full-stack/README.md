# Full Stack Developer

If you're a seasoned coder, you should have no problems with the task, but don't
worry if you're new to the game either, we just want to see is how you solve
problems and innovate while interacting with Ethereum.

We really like to see clean interfaces and well written solutions built with modern tech in mind.

**Like the real world better?** Feel free to innovate with `MINT`, `SAVE`, `SWAP` or `EARN`.. building something on top or potentially integrating with one of the many other DeFi protocols, tools or platforms out there

# Task

Young Jimmy has got a summer job working as an au pair (live in nanny) for a family down in the south of France. As he will be on call most of the day, the
family wish to stream Jimmy his payment on the Ethereum network. They are looking out for Jimmy's long term interests and want him
to save as much of it as possible for his future.

## Instructions

Create a mechanism, or an integration between two some protocols that allows the family to stream Jimmy payment for his
work and subsequently put his money to work in a yield generating mechanism.

The ideal solution would have the following components:

- Smart Contract(s) - this should allow both parties to have sufficient control of the payments, and facilitate the stream
- Frontend, API or CLI - this would allow both parties to interact with the app from a web interface
- Rationale for the chosen mechanism and a brief description of how it works

## Suggestions

- [Sablier Finance](https://sablier.me/) is a well written, battle tested payment streaming library, you could fork it
- mStable, Compound, Aave have yield generating mechanisms that allow easy, no loss access for savers
- Provide some instructions to help us get everything up and running e.g. to simulate activity on the network to make things spin

### Bonus points

- Gamification
- Innovation: Show us what you can really do
  - e.g. gas costs too high on mainnet? How about implementing some gas minimisation strategies
  - e.g. have a better idea about how Jimmy can get a fair payment? Implement it!

# Submissions

Throw your solution on Github (private or public) and send an email with the link to [jobs@mstable.org](mailto:jobs@mstable.org) along with a short message on how you are perfect for the role, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

## Testnet notes

### mStable

See the [deployed addresses](https://docs.mstable.org/protocol/deployed-addresses) of the mStable contracts on the Ropsten network or [use testnet](https://app-dot-mstable-staging.appspot.com/)

Need some bAssets to mint with? Head to [Aave Faucet](https://testnet.aave.com/faucet) for USDT and TUSD tokens, or the [Compound App](https://app.compound.finance/Asset/cUSDC) for USDC and DAI.

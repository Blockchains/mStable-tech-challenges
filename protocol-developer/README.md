# Protocol Developer

So you want to design protocol improvements and incentive mechanisms on mStable?
Mechanisms are hard to get right, particularly in the fast moving DeFi industry with overlapping incentives.

We want to see how you solve problems and innovate while interacting with Ethereum.

**Like the real world better?** Critique the [mStable protocol](https://github.com/mstable/mstable-contracts) and propose an improvement to one of our mechanisms, providing a description and pseudocode or implementation instead.

# Task 1

A University in Ukraine is hoping to incentivise collaboration in its community by rewarding students for starting clubs and societies. They will give all students 1000 `$COLAB` tokens each for the year. These tokens can be used to register interest and participate in activies in different student led societies, and the University will pay out
grants to the organisations at the end of the year based on the `$COLAB` staked with them over time.

A conscientious student named Sofia is starting up an organisation that will run gaming competitions, and will issue users with `$GAME` tokens for staking their `$COLAB` with her. Sofia wants to allow `$GAME` holders to govern overall funding for various gaming tournaments by leveraging one or more smart contracts, and `$GAME` holders will also receive a portion of the funds issued by the university at the end of the year.

## Instructions

Design and rationalise a mechanism which incentivises `$GAME` holders to govern this funding distribution effectively, with a focus on **growing the overall amount of `$COLAB` staked in Sofias society**.

The ideal solution would have the following components:

- Smart Contracts for `$GAME` & `$COLAB` with a focus on the `$GAME` distribution mechanism
- Rationale for the chosen mechanism and a brief description of how it works
  - Test output or some method of interfacing with the staking contracts

### Bonus points

- Build out or rationalise a primitive governance system using `$GAME`
- Innovation: Show us what you can really do

# Task 2

The growing DeFi ecosystem provides attractive yields for participants, but the gas costs on the Ethereum network are super high, at the expense of the small time players who don't have unlimited capital to play with.

## Instructions

Create a mechanism built on top of a popular lending market or DeFi instrument that minimises gas costs or provides incentives for the majority of participants, allowing much broader access to the public. Compare and contrast your chosen implementation against other approaches.

The ideal solution would have the following components:

- Smart Contract(s)
- Documentation contrasting the chosen implementation against other approaches
  - Test output or gas cost calculations highlighting the benefits to the market

### Bonus points

- Method of interacting with the protocol - UI, CLI or API
- Innovation: Show us what you can really do to **get people excited about your product**

# Submissions

Throw your solution on Github (private or public) and send an email with the link to [jobs@mstable.org](mailto:jobs@mstable.org) along with a short message on how you are perfect for the role, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

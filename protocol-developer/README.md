# Protocol Developer

So you want to design protocol improvements and incentive mechanisms on mStable?
Mechanisms are hard to get right, particularly in the fast moving DeFi industry with overlapping incentives.

We want to see how you solve problems and innovate while interacting with Ethereum.

**Want a real world task**? Feel free to submit an upgrade or improvement to our existing protocol [mStable-contracts repo](https://github.com/mstable/mstable-contracts) instead.

# Task 1

Design, implement, test and rationalise a solution to the following scenario.

A University in Ukraine is hoping to incentivise collaboration in its community by rewarding students for starting clubs and societies. They will give all students 1000 `$COLAB` tokens each for the year. These tokens can be used to register interest and participate in activies in different student led societies, and the University will pay out
grants to the organisations at the end of the year based on their `$COLAB` staking.

A conscientious student named Sofia is starting up an organisation that will run gaming competitions, and will reward users with `$GAME` tokens for staking their `$COLAB` with her. The `$GAME` tokens will be used to run and incentivise competitions, orchestrate society governance and GAME holders will receive a portion of the funds issued by the university at the end of the year.

## Instructions

Design and rationalise an incentive mechanism to reward early participants with `$GAME` tokens, while keeping a balance with longer term participants who are beneficial to the community and growth of the organisation.

The ideal solution would have the following components:

- Smart Contract(s)
- Rationale for the chosen mechanism and a brief description of how it works
  - Test output or some method of interfacing with the staking contracts would be useful

## Suggestions

- Test and
- Use Truffle or Buidler for creating and deploying the smart contract
- Use Ganache-cli or Ropsten as the test blockchain

### Bonus points

- Build out or rationalise a weighted voting system - how much weight would each `$GAME` token have in the decisions being made to the organisation? Would they be locked up?
- Gamification
- Innovation: Show us what you can really do

# Task 2
